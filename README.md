# Learning Playground

This is the project I use to put my notes in from different courses I take or blogs and videos I see on the internet.

This root folder on the master branch is where I try to distill and condence all the notes into something coherent that works together.

The other folder and branches of this project are what I use when I'm doing a course or just want to, as they say in Spain, "irme por las ramas" or go down a expirementing rabbit wholes.

It's also a great way for me to practice git.
